    Discussion about the grouping of the space-separated literals.
    I prefer use `` to group all the literals, and this is the only way.
    $(...) requires $$define to support regex matching, which add increase
    complexity, and the regex will penetrate the blocking effect of $. Also
    $(...) is greedy, which means if there is something like
    $()  ()$wow, it will match the ") (" part, which is not what we want. Choosing
    `` means we must support $$grouping to support `` syntax.

    Thus, the syntax for $$define is straightforward, well, we actually need to consider three
    thing, there is three elements in the sub-language, single $ macro, double $$ macro, and literal
    that means there needs to be a way to distinguish between these three types, maybe
    $$define $func #literal #func ##macro
    and for example, our standard macro library will have

    $$define $rect #width #height
        $$createNode
            type: Rect,
            width: #width
            height: #height
